Welcome! This is my blog about web development, functional programming and others geeky themes.  

I am web developer, who specialised in modern web technologies, such as Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Angular.js and others.  

I love programming as great tool to solve complex real-life problems with simplest, deadly elegant solutions.  

I love programming as hard work that combines cold logic and creativity.  

I love programming as endless act of self-perfection.  

This is why i would share with you my hacks, reviews, thoughts about programming, code snippets and more interesting stuff.
