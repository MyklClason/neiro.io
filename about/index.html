<h3 class="text-center">Hi all!</h3>
<p>
  I`m full-stack web developer, currently working with modern technologies, such as <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Angular.js</b> <i>(and other client-side MVC) frameworks</i>.
</p>
<p>
  I`m excited about <b>functional programming</b> as great paradigm to solve 
  complicated real-world problems.
</p>
<p>
  I`m also interested in some geeky tools, especially in <b>Vim</b>, <b>Tmux</b>.
