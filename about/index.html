<h2 class="text-center">Hi all!</h2>
<p>
  I'm web development professional, that specialized in modern web technologies, such as <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Angular.js</b> <i>(and other client-side MVC) frameworks</i>.
</p>

<p>
  I have work experience in the next programming languages, frameworks and others:
  <ul>
    {% for skill in site.data.skills %}
      <li>{{ skill }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  I'm excited about <b>functional programming</b> as great paradigm to solve 
  complicated real-world problems.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also interested in some geeky tools, especially in <b>Vim</b>, <b>Tmux</b>.
</p>
